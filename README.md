# Data1030FinalProject
This project aims to investigate and analyze the connections between climate risk data and race data within the United States. By exploring the intersection of climate vulnerabilities and racial demographics, important insights can be made to inform policies, interventions, and community-focused initiatives to address environmental justice issues.

Environmental justice is a critical aspect of ensuring fair and equitable access to a healthy environment for all communities, regardless of their racial or socioeconomic backgrounds. This project seeks to uncover and understand the correlations between climate risks and race, shedding light on the disproportionate impacts that vulnerable populations may face due to climate change.

Data Sources
I used a combination of publicly available climate risk datasets and demographic data from the First Street Foundation and the U.S. Census.
